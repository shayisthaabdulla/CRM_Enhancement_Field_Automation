# 🔍 CRM Field Automation & Renewal Logic Enhancements (Dynamics 365 CRM)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focused on enhancing Dynamics 365 CRM by automating key field updates and improving the renewal order workflow. The goal was to reduce manual entry, ensure accurate data propagation between orders, and provide stakeholders with timely updates via tasks and emails.

## 💡 Business Problem
Previously, several CRM fields had to be manually updated by users, which introduced a high risk of human error, delays, and inconsistencies in customer order data. Additionally, renewal orders lacked logic to copy relevant data from their parent orders, requiring repetitive updates. There was also no proactive notification system in place to inform users of important field changes.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Field Automation**: Created logic-based rules to auto-populate field values instead of relying on manual input. These included both conditional logic and value propagation from related records.
- **Renewal Logic**: Enabled automatic copying of fields from parent orders to renewal orders.
- **Task/Email Triggers**: Set up logic so that whenever a key field is updated, a task or email is automatically generated and sent to the responsible stakeholders.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Conducted sessions to understand business needs and validate field logic.
- **UAT & Post-Release Support**: Assisted in user acceptance testing and handled post-release queries to clarify logic and edge case behavior.
